# Funky Radical Electrodynamics Engine 1105 #

This Project (which can be abbreviated to FREE1105) Will Exist in 5 Phases:

1) Set Up the Electric Fields in a 2D Coordinate System
2) Simulate the Motion of Electric Point Charges
3) Simluate the Motion of Charged Rigid Bodies
4) Visualise the Field via Geometrical Curvature
5) Implement Maxwell's 4th Law for Magnetic Fields and Light

just download the folder and run the Jyptiter notebook to see each phase OR just run the main py
