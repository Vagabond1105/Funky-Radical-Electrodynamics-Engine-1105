    "This Project (which can be abbreviated to FREE1105) Will Exist in 5 Phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Set Up the Electric Fields in a 2D Coordinate System\n",
    "2) Simulate the Motion of Electric Point Charges\n",
    "3) Simluate the Motion of Charged Rigid Bodies\n",
    "4) Visualise the Field via Geometrical Curvature\n",
    "5) Implement Maxwell's 4th Law for Magnetic Fields\n",

    "\n",
    "Let us establish the checklist of aims:\n",
    "- Set Up the window to initialise a screen\n",
    "- Add a wall on the screen so as to not have particles go so far off screen\n",
    "- Be able to drag and drop particles on the 2d Screen to form point charges\n",
    "- Implement these point charges to be able to be static or not\n",
    "- Implement the necassary equations for superpositions of electric fields\n",
    "- Visualise the electric field in 2d when static before the simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes of consideration before starting:\n",
    "- I want the window and screen to have a constant aspect ratio but be able to be made bigger or smaller\n",
    "- The wall will have a means of changing the impedence or coefficient of restitution for collisions\n",
    "- The main difference with particles put in for the electric field vs those put in for test runs of their motion is when the simulation is fully reset, the electric field particles will revert to their original fitr- I mean spots (ba dum tish) whereas the added particles will simply disappear like Monkweh\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright so In Sha Allah lets do this and vaguely follow some vague classical approximation of physics in the process!!"
