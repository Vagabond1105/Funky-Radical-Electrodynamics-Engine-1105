    "1) Set Up the Electric Fields in a 2D Coordinate System\n",
    "2) Simulate the Motion of Electric Point Charges\n",

    "Let us establish the checklist of aims:\n",
    "- Set Up the window to initialise a screen\n",
    "- Add a wall on the screen so as to not have particles go so far off screen\n",
    "- Be able to add particles on the 2d Screen to form point charges with initial positions\n",
    "- Implement these point charges to be able to be static, environmental boolean values\n",
    "- Implement the necassary equations for superpositions of electric fields\n",
    "- Visualise the electric field in 2d when static as a heatmap in the baackground colour\n",
    "\n",
    "Points of Refinement After\n",
    "- implement a reset button to eliminate all non environmental charges and take everything back to inintial position and initial velocity\n",
    "- implement a right click and drop down menu to then place components like point charges and then to drag them around\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright so In Sha Allah lets do this and vaguely follow some vague classical approximation of physics in the process!!"

    "We start with 3 files:\n",
    "- the main pygame file\n",
    "- constants imported for all files\n",
    "- point charge class information\n",
    "- electric field file\n",
    "- gui file\n",
    "\n",
    "CORE:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The main pygame loop will load all the imports, initialise a screen and then set up a wall entity and throw it on there on the boundaries of the screen\n",
    "2) write in the constants file that is imported for everything\n",
    "2) Then in the point charge file, I will make a point charge class with attributes charge, mass, core_radius, border_radius, total_radius, position, pos_0, position, vel_0, velocity, environmental, static\n",
    "3) Then create a function to relatively determine core_radius in comparison to other charges and a function to do the same for the border radius with mass. Then total radius is their sum\n",
    "4) Create the electric field calculator and heatmap. Create a loop going through every pixel of a 1/4 scale virtual map and scale upwards to the full screen where in each pixel, the total net field at that space is calculated. \n",
    "5) heatmap is produced where effectively the background colour changes from default grey. at highest positive charge, it is blackest and at lowest negative charge, it is whitest. The Scale of charge will be symmetrical, so if the highest + charge is like idk 20 and highest negative is like 5, the 5 will be only 25% between grey and white whereas the posiitve will be fully black\n",
    "6) make the gui file and make the reset button as a box in the bottom left as an object of its own class\n",
    "7) make a drop down menu show up when you do a right click with for now just point charge. Then you click on the button and it opens a box containing options for its creation, being charge, mass, environmental and static toggles and the initial position is where the right click was\n",
    "8) allow the point charge to get right clicked on, with options to drag to another position for now and allowing you to update the position."
